# TTC_Project
yes...

Android app that tells you when the next TTC bus will arrive. Because opening your SMS and typing down the code is too troublesome.

Currently, this app can:
1. create trips and add stops and buses manually
2. save trip to local storage to be used again
3. check time of bus arrival

Future updates will expect:
1. Autofill for entering bus and stop ID
2. Merging with google maps to auto-fill a trip's data, based on google map's suggestion (ambitious)
3. Making UI more pretty :)

Unsolved bugs:
1. crashes when internet not available
2. some bugs when adding and removing the same bus stop ID in the edit screen before pressing done
